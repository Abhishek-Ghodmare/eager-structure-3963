This is an E-Commerce website which speciaizes in selling Cameras.Adorama Camera, Inc is a camera, electronics, and film equipment retailer launched in 1974.

In this project I have tried to manipulate dom elements, styling using css and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With efforts and the technology stack, that I have learned till Unit-4 in the Masai School, I was able to clone the whole website with same looking & features.

In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given me experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

Limitations
All pages are not responsive yet.
